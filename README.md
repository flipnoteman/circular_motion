## ROS-1 Circular Motion
A ROS-1 Noetic package to control a swarm of drones in [Malintha's Multi-UAV-Simulator](https://github.com/Malintha/multi_uav_simulator).
The goal is to have a system that will call any drones to circulate a given position. It should allow for any number of drones to join the circle at anytime.
